# Function-Evaluation-Ensemble
This JavaScript script comprises three functions showcasing different functionalities. 'first' is an arrow function that multiplies its argument by 5. 'fct1' is a function that logs the result of invoking 'first' with no argument, demonstrating its reliance on the default behavior of 'first'. The console logs the output of 'fct1'. 'fct2' takes two arguments and returns their sum. Lastly, 'fct0' prompts the user for input, converts it to a number, adds 2, and returns the result.
